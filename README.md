# House_prices

A Kaggle competition to predict the house prices with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

I tried to convert the problem to a linear regression problem by finding the lineary correlated features with the house prices, so I followed sequence of steps to prepare the data for the model

1- Dealing with the missing Values
2- Encoding the categorical feaures
3- Remove the uncorrelated features with the output
4- remove one of every two highly correlated features with each other because they have the same effect on the output 
5- remove outliers
6- normalize the house prices
